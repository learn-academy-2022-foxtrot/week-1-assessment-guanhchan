# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a version control software that is used by many people to keep track of code. It is mainly used by typing into the terminal or CMD line(on PC), It helps keep everything orgianzed when working on larger projects and if there many differnt files that need interact with one another. There is a main branch where everything will eventually merge into, when working on something new, it best to check out a new branch and start code from there so there will not be any conflict with the main branch. When done working with the code files you can commit the code and start a pull request to merge your code to the main branch. Github is an public online platform that used git help developers store and share thier work where team memeber can easliy access the code direcly from the site or cloning the repository. 

Researched answer: Git is a free open source version control system used in the programming world. It is a very powerful tool for sharing and contributing code with other people when working on a project. Github is a cloud base hosting service that allow you to manage git repositories.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Any time there is a conditional or a comparision that will either have a true or false value. For example: if you are going to compare a string  "5" to and int/number 5
The answers will very depending if you use == or === with == you are doing a loose comparison , the result will be true vs === the result will be false becuase "5" is a string and 5 is a number. Also if you compare two values with < > you will also get a Boolean value in return.

Researched answer: There are relational operators which looks for a relationship between two values < > >= <= , and there are Logical operators that are and "&&", or "||", and not "!".  When using these operators they wiill return a Boolean value.  

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: The index is the location of the item/object in the given array/string. The difference between index and value, index will store the location and value hold the item/object at said location.

Researched answer: Index stores JavaScript data type at a specific location starting from a 0 based index. Each element in an array is a value and has an index.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings.

Your answer: An array is a list of values that are javascript data type and strings are a group of chars and are a type of javascript data type. Strings can be converted into arrays with some built in methods.

Researched answer: Array and string have a lot of sililar properties, both are collection of items and have a length property and based on zero index. Arrays can have all javascript data types in the list and sting are only limited to chars and number.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: The idea of pair programming is two people working on one code source at a given time. There will be a driver and a co pilot "navigator". The driver will wrtie the code in the IDE and the pilot will help guide the driver when needed and help talk through the problem, in pair programming, communication is key, It allow two heads working togethyer on the same problem  both trying to achive the same goal.

Researched answer: Two people working on the same code trying solve/ build on the same code source. When pair programming, two set of eyes will make it easier to catch mistakes and help distribute the brain power. It works really well when the team has great communication between the driver and the navigator. The driver is the person writiing the code and the navigator will help the driver with syntax and thinking through the process.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: built in method in Javascript that take in a func as argurment, designed to operate on arrays

2. Jest: its a JavaScript testing framework to ensure correctness in codebase.  Created by facebook 

3. Objects: JS data type that has collection of key: value pairs. Object can contain static inforation and action in forms of methods

4. Method: js methods are actions that can be preformed on objects

5. Classes: It is a blueprint for objects , and classes are reusable and customizable almost like a functions
